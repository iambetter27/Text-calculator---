I had the idea to create a text calculator.
So I did one... not really advanced (cause i'm beginner...).
But now I refined my old code and I've now added exponentials and decimals now, which is great!

I plan to add parentheses, which is my next step.

To interact, work with (+, -, *, /, ^ (for exponential))
